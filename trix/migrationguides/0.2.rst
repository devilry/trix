================================
Migrate to Trix 0.2 (2013-11-19)
================================

This release includes fixes to make it work after two years of not tracking the
Devilry repo.


Database changes
################
The Devilry database does not have a lot of changes. The only thing you need to
do is to add the ``languagecode`` field to the ``core_devilryuserprofile``. For
Postgres, it looks like this::

    ALTER TABLE mytrixdb ADD COLUMN languagecode character varying(100);
